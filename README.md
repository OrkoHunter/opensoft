# opensoft

Open Soft is an application based programming competition which takes place every year at IIT Kharagpur in which teams from different Halls of Residence try to make the best out of a problem statement. https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Open_Soft

I'll push all of my related works in this repository as after all, the name has the word _"open"_ in it. ;)

Clone the repository with

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/OrkoHunter/opensoft
